# Grand Rivers Reforked

Grand Rivers Reforked: Expanding the might of Rimworld's waterways once again, *again*!.

[Grand Rivers Reborn](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1675451818) fork with added "small river" with the width of the Vanilla "river", and the creek returned to just under its vanilla width.

I recommend using it alongside [Epic Rivers](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1668694277), to add one more tier of river (50 wide!).

# Why?
I really like Grand Rivers Reborn, but I wanted my creeks to be like creeks, and I also felt that the 7-wide river ("Creek" in Grand Rivers Reborn) was similar to certain rivers near where I live.

In my opinion, creeks range from something you can jump over to something you'd put a bridge over at a restaurant. Rivers range from something you can really only take a canoe, tube, or raft down (the new "Small River"), all the way to something you could bring a shipping vessel through (Huge River or even Epic River).
